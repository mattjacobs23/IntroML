# Some machine learning projects which I learned a lot from

The projects involve the following:

* [SQL at Scale](https://github.com/mattjacobs23/IntroML/blob/main/notebooks/Databricks/Mini_Project_SQL_with_Spark.ipynb) with Apache Spark.
* [Data Wrangling](https://github.com/mattjacobs23/IntroML/blob/main/notebooks/Databricks/Mini_Project_Data_Wrangling_at_Scale_with_Spark.ipynb) at Scale with Apache Spark.
* [Machine Learning](https://github.com/mattjacobs23/MachineLearning/blob/main/notebooks/Databricks/Mini_Project_Spark_ML.ipynb) with Spark Datasets & Dataframes, Spark SQL, and Spark ML (with some MLlib too).
* [Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/mattjacobs23/IntroML/blob/main/notebooks/BERT_Tutorial_How_To_Build_a_Question_Answering_Bot.ipynb)
* [Ensemble Methods](https://github.com/mattjacobs23/IntroML/blob/main/notebooks/Ensemble_randomForest.ipynb)

Regression, classification, clustering, anomaly detection, decision trees, random forest, XGBoost, SVM, neural nets (CNN, RNN, LSTM), generative adversarial neural network (GAN), recommendation systems, probabilistic inference (Na√Øve Bayes, Hidden Markov model), A/B testing.
