# My introductory machine learning projects

The projects include the following concepts:

* [SQL at Scale](https://github.com/mattjacobs23/IntroML/blob/main/notebooks/Databricks/Mini_Project_SQL_with_Spark.ipynb) with Apache Spark.
* [Data Wrangling](https://github.com/mattjacobs23/IntroML/blob/main/notebooks/Databricks/Mini_Project_Data_Wrangling_at_Scale_with_Spark.ipynb) at Scale with Apache Spark.
